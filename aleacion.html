"Alloy of Law" is a fantasy novel written by the American author Brandon Sanderson. Its original version was published on November 8, 2011, by Tor Books, and the Spanish translation was published in Spain by the Nova publishing house on September 19, 2012. It is the fourth novel in the Mistborn series, followed by "Shadows of Self" and "Bands of Mourning," which form the second trilogy of this series.</p>

                <h2 class="tituloh2">Plot development</h2>
                <p class="parrafo1">Following the popularity of the first trilogy and to prepare readers for a second one, Sanderson wrote this novel as a transitional sequel, which ended up becoming the first book of the Wax and Wayne trilogy, set 300 years after the conclusion of what is known as Era 1 in the Mistborn series, thus inaugurating Era 2 of this saga. This book was followed by "Shadows of Self," originally published in English on October 6, 2015.</p>

                <h2 class="tituloh2">Synopsis</h2>
                <p class="parrafo1">Three hundred years have passed since the events narrated in the first trilogy of the saga, and Scadrial is now nearing modernity: railways, canals, electric lighting, and the first skyscrapers have invaded the planet. While science and technology face new challenges, the ancient magic of Allomancy continues to play a crucial role. In an area known as the Roughs, crucial tools exist for those men and women who seek to establish order and justice. One of these men is Lord Waxillium Ladrian, an expert in metals and in the use of Allomancy and Feruchemy.

After living for twenty years in the Roughs, Wax has been forced, due to a family tragedy, to return to the metropolis of Elendel. However, much to his chagrin, he must lay down his weapons and assume the obligations demanded by being surrounded by the noble class. Or so he believes, as he is not yet aware that the mansions and elegant tree-lined streets of the city can be even more dangerous than the plains of the Roughs. A metallic skyline of mist, ash, and steam dominates the threatening sky above, endangering all those who live and struggle beneath it.</p>

                <h2 class="tituloh2">Characters</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="fb">Wax</span>: Waxillium “Wax” Ladrian, a descendant of Breeze's house from the original trilogy, he is in his forties, a lawman with twenty years of experience. After leaving his life as a lawman in the Roughs, he returns to rebuild his House, which his uncle left poor and destitute. He is an excellent shot and an astute investigator. He is a Twinborn known as a "Crasher," with the Allomantic ability to Push metals and the Feruchemical ability to increase or decrease his weight.</li>
                    <li><span class="fb">Wayne</span>: Wax's best friend and deputy, Wayne follows Wax back to the city and pesters him to rejoin the law career. Also a Twinborn, he is Allomantically able to make speed bubbles, in which time is compressed and speeds up; he can also Feruchemically store health in goldminds to heal quickly, in exchange for a period of poor health. He is skilled at disguises, and mimicking accents.</li>
                    <li><span class="fb">Marasi</span>: An intelligent woman, she studies law in the university and has a passion for statistics. After hearing the stories of Wax and Wayne's good deeds in the Roughs, she becomes a fan and tags along with them. She can Allomantically create speed bubbles that slow down time inside the bubble, while outside the bubble time flows freely-a talent she is mostly embarrassed of as she sees it at useless. She is an illegitimate child of Lord Jackstom Harms, and is Steris' half-sister.</li>
